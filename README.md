## The Application 🌮
How the application works is that once the user has entered this raw indgredients information, the application will use third party application programming interfaces (APIs) to search for possible recipes and meal ideas that can be made using the ingredients the user has indicated they have available. 

The APIs will compare the user's ingredients to a database of menu items and return suggestions for meals that can be made with those ingredients, along with detailed recipes and cooking instructions. This will allow users to quickly and easily plan meals and make the most of the ingredients they have on hand, without having to spend time searching for recipes or menu ideas on their own.
